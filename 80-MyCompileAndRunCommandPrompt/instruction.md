# Compile and Run Java with Command Prompt
------------------------------------------
1. Make sure you have Java JDK installed (we did this in lesson #1)
2. (optional) use a text editor and save a file as .java
3. Open Command Prompt (windows) or Terminal (Mac and Linux) on your computer
<!-- 4. set path=C/Program Files/Java/jdk-17.0.1/bin (where JDK is located) -->
4. set path=/lib/jvm/jdk-17/bin (where JDK is located) 
5. cd /home/chun/eclipse-workspace/80-MyCompileAndRunCommandPrompt (or wherever your java file is)
6. javac HelloWorld.java (to compile)
7. java HelloWorld (to run a .class file, it's portable)
